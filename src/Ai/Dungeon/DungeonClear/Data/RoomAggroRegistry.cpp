        // five Slad'ran Summon Targets (29682) sit 29-73yd SOUTH at y 606-646, i.e.
        // right on top of the trash. The two Vipers at 90% and three Constrictors at
        // 50% (75% heroic) therefore SPAWN inside the trash packs and run north
        // through them, and Poison Nova (55081, 15yd) pushes the whole party 17yd
        // outward into them every 16-53s.
        //
        // THE ROOM IS THE NINE ELITES, and only those:
        //   * 29774 Spitting Cobra          x5, spawns 26.9-62.0yd — level 77, hp x4
        //   * 29768 Unyielding Constrictor  x4, spawns 29.9-48.0yd — level 77, hp x4
        //
        // radius 75 is measured, not read from a script, and it is sized off the
        // PATROL envelope rather than the spawn points. Two of the four constrictors
        // are MovementType 2: guid 127014 runs path 1270140 (28 points, 24.9-69.9yd
        // from the boss) and guid 127017 runs path 1270170 (26 points, 33.2-64.1yd).
        // So the real far edge of the room is 69.9, not the 62.0 the spawn rows
        // suggest — a radius sized to the spawns would drop a patrolling constrictor
        // out of the set at the far end of its path and call the room clear while it
        // was still walking back. 75 covers 69.9 and still stops short of the NEXT
        // room's mobs of the same entries: the nearest non-room Spitting Cobra is
        // 79.5yd out and the nearest non-room Unyielding Constrictor 88.9yd. (Of the
        // 12 cobras and 12 constrictors on map 604 only these 9 are Slad'ran's; the
        // rest reach 153 and 209yd.)
        //
        // WHY THE WHITELIST, given every entry on it reads hostile anyway. It is here
        // to keep two NON-threats out of the room set:
        //
        // (1) 29630 Fanged Pit Viper, x86 at 21.1-71.3yd — the snakes carpeting the
        //     pit floor. These were briefly whitelisted so the clear would sweep them;
        //     a live run showed that going badly, and they should not have been in
        //     scope to begin with. They are faction template 7 — FriendGroup 0,
        //     EnemyGroup 0, no Enemies_* — so they stand NEUTRAL and never aggro on
        //     proximity; nothing but a stray AoE brings them into the fight, and at
        //     level 1 with HealthModifier 1 that same AoE kills them outright. They
        //     were never part of the room-joins-the-fight problem, and clearing them
        //     meant 86 individual engage cycles strung across a 70yd room against a
        //     180s RoomClearTimeout. Leaving them alone is free.
        // (2) 29834 Drakkari Frenzy, x8 within 73yd but at z 104-110 — down in the
        //     MOAT, ~20yd below the boss platform (the column under the Slad'ran
        //     altar has water at 110.14 and ground at 103.22, no 129 surface). These
        //     DO read hostile, so an empty "any hostile" row would count them and
        //     send the clear after mobs it cannot walk to: the Pandemonius failure
        //     above, orbiting the boss until the timeout expires.
        //
        // The 13321 Frogs and 29637 Crafty Snake are critters and the 29682 Summon
        // Targets carry UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE, so IsPossibleTarget already drops
        // those three without help from the whitelist.

        // here (Slad'ran's aggro range + his 2.0 combat reach + the bot's + margin 2
        // + padding 3), so at most the single closest Spitting Cobra (26.9yd) falls
        // inside it and comes with the boss as a normal 1-boss + 1-add pull — the
        // same call the Gilnid row makes for its two Craftsmen. Shrinking the
